Info:

A new teleporter model for use in q3a and ta.  

Simply place this under your baseq3 dir (unpack it if you want) and in radiant you should be able to access telestecki.md3 from the map object entity menu.  

It's roughly about the same size as id's teleporters, but you should noclip a brush for the stand to give it that proper look.


not to be used as a base for other models or redistribution (other than within levels) without written concent from stecki@quakerally.com

thanks to Shallow[BAP] for that quick little test.
